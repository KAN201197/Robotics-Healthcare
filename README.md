# ME5412 Robotics for Healthcare Project

This project aims to design and develop the concept of an **Autonomous Feeding Robot** which can be used by **disability people**. The clinical problem of this project is to assist individuals with upper extremity disabilities with feeding. The robot has a design like robot arms that has 6 DOF (Degree of Freedom) and has been designed using **SOLIDWORK**. The objective of this project can be seen below:

1. More intuitive and customizable user control for better eating experience
2. Improved bite transfer to allow feeding food into the userâ€™s mouth
3. Mechanism to improve food acquisition and more versatile attachments
4. Design a locking mechanism to secure robot arms and improve safety
